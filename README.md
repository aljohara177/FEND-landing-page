It is developed using:
    - Vs Code
    - Html
    - Css
    - JS

How to run the project:

 1- Clone the repository
 2- Open Vs Code
 3- Run index.html file


Landing-page files: 
    - index.html: include the content code for the sections
    - styles.css: include the styling for the landing page
    - app.js: includes the code for the navigation and events required like click and scroll.

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality which includes:
Build navigation dinamically
Add events Listener

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.
